 ### This is a simple peer-to-peer chat application built using libp2p in Go. This project demonstrates how to:

- Initialize libp2p nodes with custom configurations.
- Establish connections between peers using multiaddresses.
- Implement custom protocols for communication (in this case, a chat protocol).
- Exchange messages over secure, multiplexed streams.

This project demostrates how nodes in a peer-to-peer decentralized system communicate to each other
